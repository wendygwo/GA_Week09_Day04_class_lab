# * create a class called Persons that hand rolls an 'each' iterator method, inside of which you
#   define some names, the each method will allow you to iterate over these
#   This means that the class you create...say Person... will respond to Person.each.
# * use a normal each loop to iterate over the class and output the names to the console.
